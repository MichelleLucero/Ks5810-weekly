    Everyone in the world is having difficult time due to the situation, and I
    hope you and people around you are doing well. As the situation worsens,
    thing in my life has been changing day by day. First of all, I just don't go
    out anymore. I order basic necessities online. I won't need to go out for
    those for now, but it may be just because I don't live with my family meaning
    I only have to take care of myself. As for school, we started our complete
    remote session today (5/19/2020) for the rest of the semester. Since the
    college had told us before this thing became more realistic, I was ready
    for it, but it was still pretty surprising when I first heard about it. One
    of the tools our college decided to use is a feature from BlackBoard called
    BlackBoard Collaborate.
    From my experience in Blackboard, I was expecting things would become much
    harder like poor connection. However, at least for I as a student taking
    lectures, things went surprisingly well and smooth. I appreciate
    the professors and the owner of technologies who made these accessible for
    us.
    It feels a bit wired staying in my room for whole day, but I feels
    like there's more time to do stuff since there's no need to go anywhere.
