<p align="center">
    Our team (Matthew, Umar and Me) decided contributing to
    <href="https://inkscape.org/">InkScape</a>. I have'nt heard of the project
    before, but it seemed like an useful tool. Also this project has detailed
    and great documentation about contribution.

##### Building and Running

This is my first time using GitLab, so I registered to it and did some 
configurations like adding my ssh public key. Then, I cloned the repo and 
started following instructions. They have a script that installs all 
dependencies, but it did not work even though I am using a derived distribution 
from Ubuntu. I decided to look at the [script][DEPS_SCRIPT] and copied the 
ubuntu section to a .sh file with conditional statements and variables excluded 
to install them all at once rather than installing a dependency one by one as
bootstrap only says I am missing a package for single execution (leaned from the 
[LibreOffice evaluation][LIBREOFFICE_EVAL]). Now that Cmake successfully 
generated a Makefile, it's time to build the source code by running `make`. This 
time, I tried running with a built-in Linux command called `time` to see total 
build time because I missed how long building LibreOffice, which has almost 10 
million lines of code, took. It is so sad I fall asleep after waiting for four 
hours. By the way, default logs of cmake look really nice. They are colored and 
output percentages that show progress next to every compilation step. When the 
building is done, output of `time` says the execution took 6374 seconds which is 
about 106 minutes. It was less than my expectation. Then, I executed `make 
install` and `make check` which is a test command to the compilation and linking 
were done right. The output of `make check` says:
```text
97% tests passed, 2 tests failed out of 69

Total Test time (real) =  15.17 sec

The following tests did not run:
	 43 - cli_export_ps_check_output (Skipped)
	 45 - cli_export_eps_check_output (Skipped)
	 47 - cli_export_pdf_check_output (Skipped)
	 49 - cli_export_emf_check_output (Skipped)

The following tests FAILED:
	 35 - cli_export_type_check_output (Failed)
	 53 - cli_export_xaml_check_output (Failed)
 
```
I am too tired, so I don't know what those messages mean. Let's try running
the executable, `install_dir/bin/inkscape`. It runs and looks working properly 
at least for now.

##### Which Issues To Work On?
- Translation  
I was thinking about mainly doing translation, but it looks like most of
Japanese translations have been already done. I will keep looking for this 
though.
 
- Website Development  
The project use Django as its primary framework. I worked on the framework
for my capstone project. It can be a good choice for brushing up my skill on it.

- Build System  
Build system is one of my interest as well. I enjoy writing Bash Scripts
Makefile, and CMake(pretty simple stuff...). In addition, I do not think this is a
choice for a newbie like me, but I will keep an eye on documentations and 
issues on this.

##### Other Stuff

##### Outside Activity
I added my family's favorite drug store in my home town. The name that the place
is "CREATE".
