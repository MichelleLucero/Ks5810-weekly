    Our team (Matthew, Umar and Me) decided contributing to
    <href="https://inkscape.org/">InkScape</a>. I have'nt heard of the project
    before, but it seemed like an useful tool. Also this project has detailed
    and great documentation about contribution.

##### Building and Running

This is my first time using GitLab, so I registered to it and did some 
configuration like adding my ssh public key. Then, I cloned the repo and 
started following instructions. They have a script that installs all 
dependencies. However, it did not work even though I am using a derived derived
distribution from Ubuntu. I decided to look at the [script][DEPS_SCRIPT] and
copied the ubuntu section to a .sh file with conditional statements and 
variables excluded to install them all at once rather than installing a 
dependency one by one as bootstrap only says I am missing a package for single
execution (leaned from the [LibreOffice evaluation][LIBREOFFICE_EVAL]). Now that 
Cmake successfully generated a Makefile, it's time to build the source code by 
running `make`. This time, I tried running with a built-in Linux command called 
`time` to see total build time because I missed how long building LibreOffice 
, which has almost 10 million lines of code, took. It is so sad I fall asleep 
after waiting for four hours. By the way, Cmake default logs look nice. They are 
colored and output percentages that show progress next to every compilation 
step. When the building is done, `time` output says the execution took 6374 
seconds which is about 106 minutes. It was less than my expectation. Then, I 
executed `make install` and `make check` which is a test command to check the 
compilation and linking were done right. The output of `make check` says:
```text
97% tests passed, 2 tests failed out of 69

Total Test time (real) =  15.17 sec

The following tests did not run:
	 43 - cli_export_ps_check_output (Skipped)
	 45 - cli_export_eps_check_output (Skipped)
	 47 - cli_export_pdf_check_output (Skipped)
	 49 - cli_export_emf_check_output (Skipped)

The following tests FAILED:
	 35 - cli_export_type_check_output (Failed)
	 53 - cli_export_xaml_check_output (Failed)
 
```
I am too tired, so I don't know what those messages mean. Let's try running
the executable, `install_dir/bin/inkscape`. It runs and looks working properly 
at least for now.
