title: Working on Inkscape
---

[/]: # (SubTitle)
<p align="center">
    Our team is working on a free and open-source graphical editor called
    <a href="https://inkscape.org/">InkScape</a> licensed under Gnome General
    Public License. One of the main features of this project is that it is
    mainly used for editing vector images. <code>SVG</code> and <code>PDF</code>
    are some of the example of their format. According to <a href="https://en
    .wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics">Wikipedia</a>, "Vector graphics are
    computer graphics images that are defined in terms of 2D points, which are
    connected by lines and curves to form polygons and other shapes". Unlike
    bitmap images, they do not consist of dots, so you don't see　blurred
    squares when　you enlarge the photo. That's cool. I only new Adobe editors
    are for this　purpose since I barely use graphical editors.

##### Building and Running

This project is hosted on GitLab, and it is my first time using it. I registered 
to it first and did some configurations like adding my ssh public key. Then, I 
cloned the repo and started following the instruction. The instruction has a 
[script](
https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape-ci-docker/raw/master/install_dependencies.sh) which is supposed to install all the dependencies if 
your os distribution is supported. Since I am using a distribution derived from 
Ubuntu, it should work fine, but it didn't. I looked at the script and found 
that it does not support distributions derived from the ones 
listed in it if the `ID` variable in `/etc/os-release` has their own 
distribution name. You can refer [this directive](
https://www.freedesktoporg/software/systemd/man/os-release.html). Anyway, I
modified the script locally, changing the `ID` to my distribution. I just didn't
want to see the string `'missing dependencies'` on bootstrap as I did hundred 
times in this [LibreOffice evaluation](
https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/project-evaluation/blob/master/libreoffice_evaluation.md). Now Cmake 
successfully generated a Makefile, it's time to build the project by running 
`make`. This time, I tried running the `make` with a built-in Linux command
called `time` to see total build time because I missed the total build time of 
LibreOffice which has almost 10 million lines of code, took. Too sad I fall 
asleep after waiting for four hours. By the way, default logs of Cmake look 
really nice. They are colored and output percentages that show progress next to 
every compilation step. When the process is done, the output of `time` says it
took 6374 seconds which is about 106 minutes. I installed the binaries by `make 
install` and executed `make check` to see if the build was done right. The 
output of `make check` says:
```text
97% tests passed, 2 tests failed out of 69

Total Test time (real) =  15.17 sec

The following tests FAILED:
	 35 - cli_export_type_check_output (Failed)
	 53 - cli_export_xaml_check_output (Failed)
 
```
I don't know what those messages mean. Let's try running the executable,
`install_dir/bin/inkscape`. It opens a pretty window and looks working properly,
at least for now.


##### Which Issues To Work On?

- **Translation**  
I was thinking about mainly doing translation, but it looks like most of the
Japanese translations have been already done. I will keep an eye on this though.
 
- Website Development  
The project uses Django as its primary framework. I worked on the framework
for my capstone project. It can be a good choice for brushing up my skills in 
it.

- Build System  
The build system is one of my interest as well. I enjoy writing Bash Scripts
Makefile, and CMake(pretty simple stuff...). Also, I don't think this is a
choice for a newbie like me, but I will keep reading the documentation and 
issues on this.


##### Outside Activity

- Open Street Map:  
I added my family's favorite drug store in my home town. The name of the place
is "CREATE", but pronounced as "curieito".
