<p align="center"><b>Comments on Project Evaluation</b></p>
<p align="center">
    Umar, Mohammed and I did an <a href="https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-
    spr-2020/project-evaluation/blob/master/vscode_evaluation.md">evaluation</a>
    on vscode, which is a Microsoft's open-sourced IDE. I tried the editor
    before, and though it was super light and snappy, I did not love it.
    However, it's worth knowing it since I hear about it everywhere, and these
    are positive most of the time.

##### General Impression

As we look into the repository of the project, we found out the project is huge!
(as everyone expected). It has 639,878 lines of code and 1099 contributors. We
browsed through some files, and their documentation looks clear and concise. The
code is also self-descriptive and well commented, from a judgment based on our
random sample. Another remarkable fact is, 93.7% of its code is Typescript. My
guess was it's mostly written in JavaScript since I only knew that
[Electron][ELECTRON] (A framework that enables you to write desktop applications
using HTML, CSS, JavaScript) project. However, I thought typeScript is such a
new technology that everyone is currently trying to migrate to, so the rate is
surprising. Contributing to this project seems exciting if you use vscode
regular bases.


##### The Hard Part

We also did some research for some numbers in the project. The hardest part of
this evaluation was finding ways to count or filter the numbers. We initially
tried to count all the issues in the past six months, but after running around
in GitHub docs, finally found there is a thing called search syntax. It was a
shame on me that I didn't come up with this because I sometimes use something
similar to this on Twitter. Anyway, it is a great feature when you want to know
about a repository, or to search in GitHub in general. Here is an example of the
functionality. For example, if you are looking to find how many issues were closed in
the past six months. Let's assume that today's date is 2020-02-29, then click on
`Issues` tab in the repository, then, in the search bar right next to `Filters`
pull-down, type:  
```
is:issue is:closed :>2019-08-29
```
where `:` divides a qualifier (specifying which function to use) and a parameter
(specifies the type of value to search). You may refer to the [the
documentation][GH_SEARCH_DOC] for more details. These syntaxes can be expanded
to general search as well, such as finding a repository. Furthermore, there is
an API called [github api][GH_API] which can help you make an HTTP request with
headers that specify the values you need, but it is overkill for simple
evaluations.


##### Top Three FOSS Projects

        <dd>The technologies used in this project match my interests the best.
        I was looking for a project that uses C++ as one of its core
        languages. Most of the projects I came across are for gaming or computer graphics. However, the Electron
        project uses C++ binding JavaScript.</dd>
